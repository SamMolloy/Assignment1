This program is the HUD for a sci-fi game set on Mars.

  When the program is first opened you will see a background image of mars. Surrounding this 
image is the heads up display or HUD that would go with the game. Featured on this HUD 
are a Health meter, Oxygen level meter, armour level meter, a clock, a radar and a button to 
see a full sized map of the section of Mars you are on. On the screen is also a small red 
crosshair that follows the mouse movement.

	  Each time the program is run, the health, oxygen, and armour meters will all have been 
randomised. This is to show what it would look like at various points throughout the 
game. The numbers representing your health, armour and oxygen all change colour 
depending on how much of each stat you have left. For example, when you have full stats 
they will all be green, if they are middling the numbers turn orange and then if they are low 
the numbers will turn red. In the case of the health and oxygen meters, if either drops below 
15, a warning sign will pop up above them which you can click to restore 25 health or 25% oxygen level.

  In the top right hand corner of the HUD is a MAP button. Once clicked this will 
  change the background image to an aerial view of Mars with a grid overlaid. On this map you 
  will see two things. The first is a small red circle which represents the player’s position and 
  also a small blue square which represents the location of the player’s objective. These will 
  change location every time the program is restarted.  This is all shown in a key under the 
  map. Beside this key there is an exit button that will return you to the first screen with your 
  crosshair, health, oxygen etc.
